# ***Battleship Game***
***Battleship Game with Local Area Network (LAN)***

## _About Game_
***In this assignment, we implement a Battleship Game with Local Area Network (LAN). The game is played between two players over the local area network. In this project, we implement the program with Java Programming Language***

## _Requirements_
***You need Java 15.0.1 with installed Java Swing module to play this game. If you want to connect via Local Area Network, please synchronize the Port numbers in the Server.java and Client.java classes in the GameNetwork package. Also, you should change IP address for server to your local machine IP address in Client.java class***

## _To Compile the Code_
***First of all, you should .jar the three java classes which are BattleshipGUI, Server and Client. After Player 1 runs both server.jar and client.jar files, it will start the game by building and running the BattleShipGUI.jar file. At the same time, Player 2 will start the game by running the BattleshipGUI.jar file only after running the client.jar file***

***java -jar “correct .jar file path”***
